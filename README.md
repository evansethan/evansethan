## I'm Ethan :-)

I am a data engineer committed to modernizing and strengthening public interest organizations. I am currently enrolled in the Masters of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago. 

My skills include:
  - Python
  - SQL
  - R
  - QGIS
  - Java
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript

ðŸŒ± I continue to build my skills in machine learning, web development, data visualization, object-oriented design and more!

ðŸ”­ My previous projects have been on mapping U.S. electricity grid resilience and renewables adoption, and I am currently working on a machine learning project which helps patients find the best doctor for their needs.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... the Appalachian Trail!
