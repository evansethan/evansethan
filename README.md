## Hi, I'm Ethan :-)

I am a data engineer committed to modernizing and strengthening public interest organizations. I am currently enrolled in the M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago, where I focus on the intersection of data science, public policy, and software development.
